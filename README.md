# SAS Demo: CAPTURE

As an exercise in SAS programming, I simulate data from a clinical trial that I worked on, the CAPTURE trial ([NCT03581227](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03581227), [NCT03583099](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03583099)). Then I reproduce some of the analyses for the trial, which I implemented elsewhere in R.

The CAPTURE trial enrolled primary care patients at several practice-based research networks (PBRNs) throughout the US. At a single study visit, patients completed the CAPTURE screening tool, spirometry, and an assessment of respiratory symptoms. For selected patients, there was medical record review and a patient survey to ascertain outcomes.
